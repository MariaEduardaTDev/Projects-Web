# 🚀 Front-End Project Portfolio

Hello, and a warm welcome! 👋
My name is Maria Eduarda, and I am a passionate enthusiast of the world of technology. I am beginning my journey as a front-end developer, dedicatedly exploring the possibilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This portfolio is my space to document every step of my learning process, where each project is an opportunity to develop specific skills, overcome challenges, and grow professionally.

Here you will find my practical projects that demonstrate this constant evolution, always aiming for functional, beautiful, and responsive interfaces.

Feel free to browse and get to know my work! I am always open to constructive opinions and feedback that can help in my development. ✨
